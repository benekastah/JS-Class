Please visit [the documentation](http://benekastah.github.com/JS-Class/ "The documentation") 
or the [the unit tests](https://github.com/benekastah/JS-Class/blob/master/test/spec/javascripts/classSpec.js "Class Unit Tests")
(you know -- for examples).

More to come here later :)

If you just want to get a quick download, **all you need is `class.zip` from the Downloads area**.
If that doesn't work for you, then you can find the minified source file in `build/class.js` (or `build/class.min.js`),
and you can get the non-minified version in `src/class.js`.
